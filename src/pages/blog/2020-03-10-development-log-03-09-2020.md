description: Setting Up CMS / Defining MVP
---
Today I worked on tweaking the CMS settings to hit MVP.

High level -- MVP should be a helpful site builder just by itself, but it should also be easy for others to build and contribute.

#### Current MVP Goals/Stories

- As an end user, I have access to a landing page with a resume, and a blog
- As an end user, I should be able to customize the sections/features appear on the site
- As an end user, I should be able to customize the order on which sections appear on the landing page (this one is going to require some intermediate/advanced Gatsby but is required for some developer stories).
- As an end user, I should be able to customize the site metadata. Specifically the title, description, and favicon.
- As a developer user, I should be able to add components to the landing page without making breaking changes.
- As a developer user, I have good documentation on both how to use the repo and how to contribute.
